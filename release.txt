* When setting up nozzle changes, clicking header in goto start position (no nozzle selected) doesn't crash anymore
* Rotation coordinate now shows on status display at startup
* Rotation coordinate now stored in bookmarks
* Better diagnostics on serial port errors

* Internal code improvements, more logging information in certain situations
