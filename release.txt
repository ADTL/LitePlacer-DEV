New Features, significant changes

* Altium17 pnP file loads without edits (mm's only)
* Added a button to clear "placed" information
* Simpler dialog for inputting fiducial coordinates on panelizing

Bug Fixes

* Fixed using placement with nominal coordinates (no measurements)
* Label for vacuum now mentions valve (helps first time troubleshooting)
* For developers: Debugger ignores motor power timer interrupts
* Negative coordinates in CAD data handled correctly on bottom side placement
* Alt+F4 now asks before closing (too easy to accidentally close everything 
  when trying to do Alt+F5 jog)
* Job offset is remembered between runs
