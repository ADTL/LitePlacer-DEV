New Features, significant changes

* Improvements for fiducial recongnition, mainly for boards
  without standard fiducials:
  - Fiducials can be round, rectangle or either.
  - User adjustable tolerance (how close to nominal position
    the fid needs to be found). this is useful if a via or pad is
	is used as a fiducial, and there might not be much clearance
	to the closest board item.
  - Optional manual copnfirmation for a found fid, to ensure the
    intended board feature is selected.
