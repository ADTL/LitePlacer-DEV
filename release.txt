New Features, significant changes

* New method for saving settings. A settings transfer program
  must be run before using this release!
* Application settings can now be loaded and saved

Bug Fixes 
 
 * Adding a row to empty jobdata or CADdata table doesn't crash anymore.
 * More stable file handling in some environments
 * Much better handling of scaled displays, minor display adjustments
 * Added label for default nozzle.
 * Fixed issue when default nozzle was 0.
 * Pump on/off needs a dummy move. This is now +/-0.01mm Z axis, which
   is faster and much less annoying
* It is now possible to calibrate nozzles even with nozzle correction disabled
* CAD data file header text is now case-insensitive
* If a tape does not have a nozzle defined, it is now a warning, not a crash
* Nozzle height calibration process is more stable. It should not be possible
  to get the process into undefined state by clicking start/next or cancel
	when the previous move is still ongoing.
* Nozzles setup remebers warning treshold. The default is 1.0mm
* Z probing hysteresis default is 0.2mm
